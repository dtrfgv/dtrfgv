Package: tplda
Description: This package implements "The Tree Penalized Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm (TPLDA)".
   It is a new-tree based approach which constructs a classification rule based on groups of variables. 
   It consists in splitting a node by repeatedly selecting a group and then applying a regularized linear 
   discriminant analysis based on this group. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is 
   satisfied. A pruning strategy is proposed to select an optimal tree.
