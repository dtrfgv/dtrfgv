Package: dtrfgv
Description: This package implements "The CART for Grouped of Variables (CARTGV)" 
   algorithm and the "Random Forests for Grouped Variables (RFGV)" algorithm, 
   for binary classification problems. CARTGV is a new-tree based approach which 
   constructs a decision trees based on groups of variables. RFGV is a new 
   random forest algorithm based on a modified version of CARTGV. RFGV allows to 
   build random forest for grouped variables.
